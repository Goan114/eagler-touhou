# Release engineering and public deployment

This document is for project maintainers and defines formal candidates, pre-release verification, and public behavior requirements. Ordinary self-host operators should use [`SELF_HOSTING.md`](SELF_HOSTING.md) and [`SELF_HOSTING_REFERENCE.md`](SELF_HOSTING_REFERENCE.md).

The project's responsibility ends at generating and verifying a complete site. `npm run release` does **not** log in to a server, install a Web server, modify systemd, firewalls, certificates, or CDN settings, or perform a public cutover.

## Formal candidate entrypoint

There is one public maintainer entrypoint for formal candidates:

```text
npm run release -- --input=D:\ReleaseInputs\release.json --output=D:\Releases\candidate
```

The input uses `eagler-touhou/release-input/1`. A formal Release covers every
non-test product in canonical order and explicitly provides:

- one verified, resource-free Runtime Release covering every registered game,
  including Runtime artifacts retained for validation-only products;
- original-resource directories for TH06, TH07, and TH08;
- a maintainer feature configuration;
- an explicit music mode;
- font, language-pack, or custom artwork inputs when required.

Copy [`tools/maintainer/release-input.example.json`](../tools/maintainer/release-input.example.json)
next to the paths it will reference, then replace its relative placeholders.
The committed template deliberately contains no private resource location,
credential, server address, or output path. Optional `prepare` fields are
`Th06LanguagePacks`, `Th07LanguagePacks`, `ArtworkDirectory`, `FontFile`, and
`VanillaFontFile`; the optional top-level `gameDataFallback` contains an HTTPS
`url` and an optional user-facing `hint`. The release owner always supplies
the output directory from the command line.

When an immutable External resource origin still exposes language packs from
an older compatible Package revision, the optional top-level
`externalResourceIndex` points at a local metadata snapshot containing that
origin's `host-manifest.json`, `release-catalog.json`, and referenced Package
Descriptors. The release owner includes the snapshot in input provenance and
accepts its language URLs only after proving that all non-language Package
components and file identities exactly match the new Hosted generation. This
changes only the derived External metadata; it never copies language payloads
into the user-facing site.

The formal entrypoint does not accept `Th08Build`, Emscripten, CMake, or Ninja. Runtime compilation belongs to the Runtime Release producer, not the site release.

`tools/maintainer/assemble-site.ps1` is the low-level maintainer implementation currently reused by `npm run release`. It is neither the ordinary self-host CLI nor a server deployment interface. Ordinary operators must not depend directly on its PowerShell parameter shape.

The target directory must not already exist. The release owner builds and verifies the candidate under `.release-incomplete/` in the target's parent directory, then atomically renames it into place only after verification succeeds. Process-level scratch uses the operating system's temporary directory. Output includes hosted, external, and import sites, Package content, offline ZIPs, an input manifest, Release Manifest, checksums, and a completion report.

The completion report uses `eagler-touhou/completion-report/1` and records:

```text
IMPLEMENTED
BUILD-VERIFIED
STRUCTURE-VERIFIED
RUNTIME-VERIFIED
SEMANTIC-VERIFIED
HUMAN-ACCEPTED
RELEASED
```

Generating a local candidate does not present unexecuted browser, semantic, human, or real-publication checks as complete, and it does not promote `RELEASED` to `yes`.

Verify a generated candidate independently with:

```text
npm run verify:release -- D:\Releases\candidate
```

This checks the Release Manifest and checksums, fixed output layout, Package Descriptors, offline ZIPs, and completion report. It does not replace real-browser or human acceptance.

After verification, generate public GitHub Release assets from that exact
candidate with `tools/maintainer/build-github-release-assets.ps1`. Do not use
an unrelated Runtime directory or a manually typed version as a second release
authority; see [`tools/maintainer/PUBLIC_RELEASE_ASSETS.md`](../tools/maintainer/PUBLIC_RELEASE_ASSETS.md).

A Runtime Release may contain only distributable project HTML, JavaScript, WebAssembly, and declarative layout metadata. It must not contain `.data`, original `.dat` files, original music, card artwork or icons extracted from the original games, or user data. Game Runtime source provenance belongs to the Runtime Release producer; the site release records only Launcher-side provenance.

## Artifact authority and resource mode

Artifact authority and resource delivery are independent dimensions:

- `web-development` and `web-validation-*`: development or validation artifacts, not formal candidates;
- `web-release-*`: eligible to enter a formal candidate;
- `hosted`: the site publishes game resources generated by the operator;
- `external`: the site publishes the Launcher, Runtime, Release Catalog, and Package Descriptors while infrastructure redirects game and shared payload routes to an external HTTPS origin;
- `import`: the site publishes the Launcher, App Shell, and app-owned Runtime, while players import complete game packages themselves.

A formal release first generates and verifies the hosted site, then derives the external site, import site, and offline ZIPs from **that same hosted build**. It never re-reads unrelated historical artifact identities. External output retains the small, frequently updated Runtime HTML, JavaScript, and WebAssembly files locally; only Package payload routes are delegated to infrastructure.

The paired `hosted-site/` resource origin and `external-site/` user site have a
coordinated routing, CORS, Range, cache, cutover and rollback procedure. See
[`EXTERNAL_RESOURCE_MODE.md`](EXTERNAL_RESOURCE_MODE.md).

The maintainer feature configuration uses `eagler-touhou/server-features/1` and is a low-level release-assembly input. Ordinary self-host users do not write it manually; `eagler-touhou.config.json` owns ordinary operator configuration.

Existing deployments retain read compatibility for `import-only` and `import-partial`. New configuration and artifacts accept and emit only `import`.

## Original resources, languages, and music

Neither the public repository nor a Runtime Release contains original `.dat` or `.data` files, WAV, OGG, Replay files, original fonts, or user saves. A formal hosted candidate must generate deployable resources on the maintainer's machine from legally owned original directories.

Site assembly:

1. verifies the Runtime Release;
2. generates DATA, optional OGG, language packs, and Launcher artwork from explicit original inputs;
3. assembles the static site and Package Descriptors;
4. generates the App Shell;
5. verifies the complete site;
6. publishes only the final candidate across the release-output boundary.

`host/requirements.txt` exclusively declares Python asset-tool dependencies. Formal release uses a task-private Python environment and does not depend on the caller having preinstalled `soundfile`, Pillow, or fontTools.

Default self-host assembly prepares Japanese, Simplified Chinese, and English. If a formal release uses a custom language set, every non-`ja` `lang_*` entry must have a corresponding generated language pack. The Runtime downloads only the language resources selected by the player.

Remote installation and offline ZIPs use the same `eagler-touhou/package/1` Package Descriptor. A maintainer may generate an offline package for one game from an assembled site with:

```text
npm run package:offline-game -- D:\Sites\eagler-touhou th06
npm run package:offline-game -- D:\Sites\eagler-touhou th07
```

Historical `game-data-pack/1` and `offline-game-pack/1` formats are read-compatible only; new producers do not emit them.

## Public Web behavior

The generated `site/` is an ordinary static site suitable for nginx, Caddy, Apache, IIS, object storage/CDN, containers, or other infrastructure. The project does not prescribe a server operating system or Web server.

The public deployment must provide at least:

- HTTPS at the public entrypoint;
- `application/wasm` for `.wasm` and a correct JavaScript MIME type for JavaScript;
- revalidation rather than indefinite caching for HTML, JSON, and unversioned entrypoints;
- long-lived caching for content-versioned resources;
- CDN cache keys that preserve resource query parameters, including at least `v`;
- optional Brotli/Gzip according to infrastructure capabilities;
- response policies that do not block the required iframe, WASM, audio, or Service Worker behavior.

`examples/deployment/nginx.conf` is one example of these behaviors. It is not an authoritative deployment implementation and does not install nginx.

Verify a local artifact before deployment:

```text
npm run verify:server -- D:\Sites\eagler-touhou
```

Verify final behavior from the real public URL after deployment:

```text
npm run verify:deployed -- https://example.invalid/
```

The operator owns the concrete directory switch, object-storage versioning, container rollout, or CDN publication mechanism. The project requires only that a user cannot receive mismatched HTML, JavaScript, WASM, DATA, or manifests during cutover.

## WebSocket Relay and TURN

Multiplayer services and the static site are separate infrastructure. The site configures only a WebSocket Relay URL. The signaling/relay service manages TURN and provides usable STUN/TURN information plus short-lived credentials to browsers.

Maintained server-side implementations live at:

```text
server/netplay-relay.mjs
server/render-coturn-config.cjs
server/coturn.env.example
```

The project contract does not prescribe systemd, Docker, Kubernetes, a process manager, or an external hosting service. Real public Relay/TURN verification tools live under `tools/maintainer/`; they inspect explicit targets and do not enter the hermetic `npm run check`.

## HTTP-to-HTTPS data migration

HTTP and HTTPS are different Origins. Moving the path from `/eagler-touhou/` to `/` does not change the Origin, but moving from HTTP to HTTPS does change the browser storage boundary.

During the migration window, both the old HTTP Origin and new HTTPS Origin must remain available. On the old HTTP page, `migrate.html` reads browser-local data and transfers it to the HTTPS receiver through a constrained `postMessage` protocol. Data is never uploaded to the server.

Only a Host Manifest built for the migration window declares:

```json
{
  "originMigration": { "mode": "http-to-https" }
}
```

Migrated data includes:

- TH06/TH07/TH08 saves, Replays, settings, and thprac files for supported games;
- Launcher settings;
- Package Store installation, generation, and object data;
- explicitly owned local-resource caches.

Migration uses **owner-scoped, explicit overwrite of real conflicts**. Non-conflicting old data migrates automatically. When the target already has a conflict, HTTPS data is retained by default and is overwritten only when the user explicitly selects that owner. An owner absent from the old HTTP source cannot delete HTTPS target data.

During the migration window:

- do not enable HSTS;
- the exact HTTP `/migrate.html` URL must remain directly accessible;
- do not let a permanent HTTP-to-HTTPS redirect take over the migration page early;
- ordinary HTTP page visits must still redirect cleanly to HTTPS without starting migration automatically.

Verify before cutover:

```text
npm run verify:migration-cutover -- http://example.invalid/ https://example.invalid/
```

## Final HSTS cutover

The HSTS lifecycle has exactly two project states. It does not introduce an unrelated trial mode:

```text
migration window
  HSTS disabled
        |
        | migration retired
        v
final HTTPS
  Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000
```

To end the migration window:

1. remove the `originMigration` capability from the Host Manifest and regenerate the site;
2. retire old HTTP `/migrate.html` as a migration entrypoint;
3. send `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000` or longer on final HTTPS responses;
4. if TLS terminates at a CDN or edge, confirm that the final client response still carries the header;
5. run the final verifier against the real public entrypoint.

```text
npm run verify:hsts-cutover -- http://example.invalid/ https://example.invalid/
```

This check verifies only final public behavior: ordinary HTTP entrypoints redirect to HTTPS, HTTPS publishes at least one year of HSTS, and the Host Manifest no longer declares `originMigration`. It is independent of whether the site uses nginx, Caddy, Apache, IIS, object storage, or a particular Linux distribution.

`includeSubDomains` and HSTS preload are not default policy. Enable either only after the operator explicitly commits every affected subdomain to long-term HTTPS.

After a browser has learned HSTS, future bare-domain HTTP attempts can be upgraded to HTTPS locally. A new browser that has never learned HSTS cannot invent that upgrade while completely offline unless the domain separately enters the preload list.
