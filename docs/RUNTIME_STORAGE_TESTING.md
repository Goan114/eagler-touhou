# Runtime Storage verification

The platform contract is defined by the workspace-level `docs/invariants/runtime-storage.md`. Game parameters reuse the `storage` declaration in `product-catalog.mjs`; do not maintain another game registry.

## Source/protocol gate

`npm run test:storage` (also run by `npm run check`) executes all three real Shell scripts in isolated VMs with mocked DOM and FS surfaces. It covers the restore barrier, failure, late success after timeout, read/write/remove operations, synchronization error propagation, and unsafe paths. This is L3/module evidence and does not prove browser IndexedDB behavior.

## Browser conformance

Start the current workspace server on port 8130 with `npm start`, then explicitly provide owned fixtures at `<fixture-root>/<game>/score.dat`:

```powershell
npm run test:storage:browser -- --fixture-root D:\fixtures\saves --package th08=D:\fixtures\th08-content.zip
```

`--package GAME=PATH` is repeatable and imports an explicit content package through the existing UI. The runner never selects resources automatically from `artifacts/`. Without this option, the site must already provide game DATA. Tests use isolated browser contexts and never access the user's everyday browser saves.

The default matrix is three games × Chromium/WebKit × `score-only`/`commands`. The latter adds an independent flat probe covering list/read/write/remove/sync behavior, path rejection, and persistent deletion. Both cases cover orderly shutdown, full-page reload, destruction of temporary Runtime exports, restoration, and exact byte comparison. They do not require a cold start to create a score or configuration file automatically.

`--cases nested-write` is an independent extended case that creates `probe/nested.dat`; its report does not replace `score-only`. `--cases restore-failure` uses a Playwright new-document initialization script to install a `Module` setter in the expected Runtime document and make the first `FS.syncfs(populate)` call fail, without changing product source. The Runtime must emit an error and must not reach ready/first-frame. Neither extended case runs by default. Existing game-specific scripts remain only as historical investigation entrypoints; future generic storage verification uses this runner.

Output defaults to `artifacts/validation/runtime-storage/<timestamp>/` and includes per-case JSON, exported files, and failure screenshots. A failed case exits nonzero. Console stderr is retained separately; only `pageerror` or Runtime error/fatal events constitute runtime-failure evidence. Rerun after browser or build updates. Playwright WebKit is not evidence from a real iOS device.

Each release candidate must rerun its required matrix and retain the report in that candidate's external acceptance evidence. Repository documentation does not retain dated PASS claims from a particular machine, and it never presents Playwright WebKit as proof from real Safari hardware.
